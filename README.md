## ðŸ’ª Challenge

Check out the [challenge notes](./challenge.md) for details on project requirements and submission.

## ðŸ›  Prerequisite

- [Ruby](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)
- [Bundler](https://bundler.io/)
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)

A working Ruby dev environment. Mac OS should come with Ruby by default, but it may not be reliable. We recommend going with a solution like [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) to manage local Ruby dev environments.

## ðŸ”§ Setup

Fork/clone/download this repo it to your computer.

Go into that directory and install dependencies by running:

```
bundle install
```

## ðŸ“‚ File structure

Below are notable folders in this project:

```
/fe-yam-site
| _data/
| _sass/
| _posts/
\ _assets/
```

The blog posts live in the `_posts/` folder.

## ðŸ•¹ Development

This project is basically an out-of-the-box Jekyll site, that was generated via `jekyll new`.

Fire up the local development server by running:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch
```

Visit the dev site at [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/).
