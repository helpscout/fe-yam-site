      value: Your boss throws out an idea like, “What if we lowered our first response
        time for customer emails?” or makes a passing comment about liking another
        brand’s new video marketing strategy. What exactly are you supposed to do
        with this information? Should you type up a job listing to hire another person
        for your Support team and order a new video camera?

      value: " while making small talk before a breakfast meeting began. It wasn’t
        until years later that the CEO realized there were blueberry muffins at every
        meeting he attended from that day forward because of that comment."

      value: Sutton goes on to say that leaders “make offhand comments and don’t consider
        that their employees may interpret them as commands.” He urges leaders not
        to waste their employees’ time by inadvertently creating unnecessary work
        with this kind of miscommunication.

      value: I’d argue this applies to relationships without power imbalances as well.
        Communicating ideas effectively is important for coworkers, couples, and even
        friends.

      value: For example, my husband Josh loves to dream, and I love to execute on
        tasks. When he throws out an idea, I can’t help but create an instant to-do
        list in my mind, whether he wants me to or not. Sutton suggests avoiding miscommunications
        by prefacing an idea with something like, “Please don’t do anything; I am
        just thinking out loud.”

      value: 'Josh and I gave this advice a shot. To avoid stressing me out, he’d
        say, “I’m in my mental sandbox” before sharing a pie-in-the-sky idea. There
        are two rules in the mental sandbox: 1.) Anything goes. 2.) No action is required.
        Josh can ask me what it would be like if he were the mayor of our city, and
        I don’t have to skip a beat sipping my hot tea to think about how we’d afford
        campaign posters.'

      marks: []
      value: The mental sandbox was a helpful tool for us, but it didn’t always work.
        When Josh would throw out ideas like, “What if we spent less time on our phones?”
        or “What if we changed up our diet?” I knew he wasn’t making demands — but
        these weren’t entirely hypothetical ideas, either. We were still running into
        mismatched expectations about what needed action and what was just daydreaming,
        and this was a source of conflict and confusion for both of us.

      value: ". I realized what I was missing all along was a middle ground — something
        in between ideas that need immediate action and mental sandbox ideas that
        need no action at all. More often than not, people need space to process verbally,
        suss things out, and gather feedback as they bounce ideas off each other to
        refine their thinking. Here’s the framework for idea discussions I came up
        with that makes room for this important middle ground:"
