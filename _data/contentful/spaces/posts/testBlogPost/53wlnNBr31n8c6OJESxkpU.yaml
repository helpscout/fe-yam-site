    - data: {}
      marks: []
      value: Historically, marketing was important in getting your product in front
        of customers. The marketing mix of price, promotion, product, and place were
        essential to convincing customers to pick up your product and give it a try.
        This cycle has entirely changed over the last 10 years as customers have become
        more connected. Recommendations from friends and family, online product reviews,
        and search results carry more weight than any traditional marketing materials.
        Customers are less likely to trust what companies say and far more likely
        to trust what they read online or hear from friends.

      value: Because of this, the customer journey is often entirely self-driven at
        this point. Customers do their own research, make their own decisions, and
        purchase by themselves using self-checkouts.

      value: Maybe you’re thinking that customer-centric marketing sounds pretty similar
        to how you already do things in your company. You do user research, collect
        customer feedback, and think about how to convert prospects to customers by
        speaking their language.

      value: Many marketing organizations are measured exclusively on the number of
        qualified leads they bring into the sales funnel. This can lead to some quick
        fix solutions designed to get customers in the door, but these tactics are
        often short-sighted, and while they might connect your sales team with a customer,
        they don’t build a long-term relationship. Customer-centric marketers avoid
        these short-term wins in favor of creating long-term value.

        tactics that nobody likes,” says Macaitis. “Those tactics degrade your brand
        integrity, and they leave you with more detractors than promoters … which
        doesn’t bode well for your long-term success!”"

      value: Customer-centric marketing needs to be hyper-personalized to be effective.
        Knowing your user personas is a great start, but in order to effectively speak

      value: Typically, teams will segment users based on their lifetime value (LTV)
        in order to target their marketing to higher-value customers. However, there
        are an infinite number of ways you can segment your user base. From the services
        they use, to how active they are, to their job titles — the more granular
        you can be about your customer base, the more specific you can be with your
        marketing strategy.

      marks: []
      value: When making decisions based on your customers’ needs, it’s critical to
        use the data that you have available to you. Rather than assuming you know
        what your customers want, look at their actions, talk directly to customers,
        and quantify both data sources.
